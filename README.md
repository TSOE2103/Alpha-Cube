# Code Fun Do

##Problem
During disaster the communication between the relief forces and victims become a major problem due to low network connectivity
Our idea is to solve this problem by creating a USSD based messaging service which aims to bring faster connectivity between victim and relief forces.

##Feasibility
USSD based systems are fast when compared to SMS based systems. So this system will work even in areas with lower network connectivity.

##Features
1.The victim can ask for help or support by selecting through various options.
2.The relief forces are able to show recent updates/location of relief camps to the victim.
