## Problem
During disaster the communication between the relief forces and victims become a major problem due to low network connectivity
Our idea is to solve this problem by creating a USSD based messaging service which aims to bring faster connectivity between victim and relief forces. We wanted to focus on usability in low connection situations.We will also work on giving the best location for the Emergency response team and also Evacuation paths will be needed during various natural tragedy's.

## Feasibility
USSD based systems are fast when compared to SMS based systems. So this system will work even in areas with lower network connectivity.It allows survivors to ask for help through a quick and efficient process and also Genetic Algorithm gives the best location for Emergency response team.We are also building an algorithm which dyanamically generates the evacuation routes during emergency situations.

## Features
1. The victim can ask for help or support by selecting through various options.
2. The relief forces are able to show recent updates/location of relief camps to the victim.
3. This will find the most efficient location in which it can serve all the locations within the city once emergency happens. 
4. Generating the Evacuation Routes during Disaster occurence.
